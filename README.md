Writing in an alien language inherently distinct from English requires crafting a system of symbols, sounds, and structures that bear no resemblance to earthly languages. This can involve creating glyphs that look entirely foreign, often based on non-linear geometries, abstract shapes, or flowing forms, such as spirals, arcs, or fractal-like patterns. These glyphs might not represent single letters or phonemes but rather whole concepts, emotions, or ideas. Grammar could eschew the linear syntax familiar in English, opting instead for layers of meaning embedded in spatial arrangements, color patterns, or textural contrasts. The "words" might shift meaning depending on their rotation, placement in a group, or the interaction of visual components, making translation into English not just difficult but conceptually incompatible.

The alien writing system could also employ elements invisible to human senses, like ultraviolet marks or sound-based inscriptions perceptible only to specific frequencies. For instance, the meaning of a text might depend on subtle vibration patterns encoded within the material used to write. The temporal dimension could further complicate interpretation; some symbols might only reveal their meaning after observing them over a span of time, where they morph, fade, or combine with others. In this way, the alien writing transcends English's rigid constructs of grammar and vocabulary, existing instead as a multi-dimensional, dynamic interplay of sensory and symbolic elements alien to human cognition.
