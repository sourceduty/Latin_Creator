### Aliencode

Writing in an alien language inherently distinct from English requires crafting a system of symbols, sounds, and structures that bear no resemblance to earthly languages. This can involve creating glyphs that look entirely foreign, often based on non-linear geometries, abstract shapes, or flowing forms, such as spirals, arcs, or fractal-like patterns. These glyphs might not represent single letters or phonemes but rather whole concepts, emotions, or ideas. Grammar could eschew the linear syntax familiar in English, opting instead for layers of meaning embedded in spatial arrangements, color patterns, or textural contrasts. The "words" might shift meaning depending on their rotation, placement in a group, or the interaction of visual components, making translation into English not just difficult but conceptually incompatible.

The alien writing system could also employ elements invisible to human senses, like ultraviolet marks or sound-based inscriptions perceptible only to specific frequencies. For instance, the meaning of a text might depend on subtle vibration patterns encoded within the material used to write. The temporal dimension could further complicate interpretation; some symbols might only reveal their meaning after observing them over a span of time, where they morph, fade, or combine with others. In this way, the alien writing transcends English's rigid constructs of grammar and vocabulary, existing instead as a multi-dimensional, dynamic interplay of sensory and symbolic elements alien to human cognition.

### New Language Decades

The time required to create, learn, teach, improve, and program a brand-new language depends on various factors, such as its complexity, intended use, and the prior experience of the creator and learners. Developing the structure of a language—its syntax, grammar, and rules—can take several months to years, depending on whether it is natural (like Esperanto) or programming-based (like Python). A basic framework for a programming language may take 6–12 months to conceptualize and prototype if it is relatively simple. However, if the language includes advanced features, integration capabilities, and unique paradigms, the timeline could extend to several years. The learning curve for users depends on the familiarity of its syntax with existing languages and the availability of supporting documentation, which might take another few months to a year to develop.

Teaching the language involves creating educational resources like tutorials, courses, and examples, which can take months to a year, depending on the language's complexity and the medium of instruction. Improving the language requires iterative feedback from users, which could span years as more use cases and edge cases emerge. Finally, programming in the language may start immediately after its initial learning phase, though expertise might take years of experience. Overall, the process of creating, refining, and proliferating a new language, from conception to maturity, is likely to take anywhere from 2 to 10 years, depending on the scale and ambition of the project.
